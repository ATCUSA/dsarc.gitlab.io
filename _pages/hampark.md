Hams at the park is a once a month event were we will go out to a park with in our region to have lunch and play with radios.

The event will be open to the public and we encourage everyone to invite as many people as possible to these outings
Lunch will be available for a small cost as a fundraiser for the club. We also would never turn down more food and drinks if people would like to donate that to the cause.
