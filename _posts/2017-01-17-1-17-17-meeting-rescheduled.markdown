Hi All,

I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting for Tuesday the 17th is going to be postponed. Heather and I are on our anniversary trip in San Diego and won't be back until Wednesday night. For more information and to take the poll on which day to reschedule click below. Once the poll has been tallied I will update this page so check back tomorrow.

73,

Austin (KF7SIW)
