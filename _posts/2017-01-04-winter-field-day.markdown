This January 28th-29th, Northwest Radio Supply and the Do Something ARC will be hosting Winter Field day at [Mountain View Park](https://goo.gl/maps/5uTHtxbyiGu "target="_blank).

Winter Field Day is a great opportunity for people to come out and play with radios in an environment less comfortable than home. The goals for this will be:

1. Set up a fully functional comms center in less than 12 hours in the middle of winter.
2. Learn and practice Voice, Digital, and CW communication.
3. Meet new people and introduce friends and family to ham radio.
4. Eat S'mores, and other good food.
5. Have fun.
