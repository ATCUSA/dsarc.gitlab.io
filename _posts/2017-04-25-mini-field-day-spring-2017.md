We will be hosting a 'mini field day' of sorts, along with other activities, food, equipment testing, and more!

While there will be a contest going on ([7QP](http://ws7n.net/7QP/new/Page.asp?content=rules){:target="_blank"}), and we will be participating in it, we are not focused primarily on points, but rather learning new equipment, trying out new toys, and just having fun!

We will be having a bbq Saturday, and most likely again Sunday, as well as food that everyone brings! We will have the opportunities for people who aren't licensed to get on the air, so if you've never tried ham radio, or your kids want to learn more, feel free to stop by!

W7UQ (the University of Idaho Amateur Radio Club) will be hosting a [**foxhunt**](http://www.arrl.org/direction-finding){:target="_blank"} as well, on Saturday from 1400-1800, and again, all are welcome! It should be lots of fun, so come on out, bring out any and all equipment you want to use, show off, or get help figuring out how to use!

If you are planning to attend, please [RSVP](https://goo.gl/forms/AaKREIHRglgpsrFm2){:target="_blank"} so we know how much food/supplies to bring. Main/Side dishes are *very* welcome, as are refreshments and other supplies.
