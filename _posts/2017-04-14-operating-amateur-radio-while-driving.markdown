New distracted driving laws have been moving though the Washington State house and senate. These amend restrictions for the use of personal electronic devices while driving. The senate bill was amended to _exclude_ ham radio from personal electronic device restrictions. Here is the relevant passage.

_A personal electronic device means a portable electronic device that is capable of wireless communication or electronic data retrieval and that is not manufactured primarily for hands-free use in a motor vehicle.  It includes cell phones, tablets, laptops, two-way messaging devices, and electronic games.  Two-way radios, citizens band radios, and amateur radio equipment are excluded from the definition of personal electronic device._

The companion bill HB 1371 is still in committee and it does have similar language excluding ham radio from electronic device restrictions.
