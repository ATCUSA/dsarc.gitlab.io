**FEMA Training**   
ICS and NIMS establish protocols for multiple agencies and groups to efficiently respond to emergency and public service (non-emergency) events. The DSARC and the groups we interact with use it often so it is strongly recommended for all members.

Follow instructions on the IS-100.B site to create a FEMA student ID before starting the course.
